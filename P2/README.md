We started out our project by coming up with an idea that felt personal to us. One thing we all found in common was a love for Boston food, and a desire to make it social! We wished there was a way for us to try out new restaurants in Boston while meeting other people also interested in similar restaurants or cuisines. We envisioned an application that could connect customers together into groups where they could participate in discounted events hosted by local restaurants - this would provide a social way to make friends, eat good food, and support local businesses. 

Beginning with the E-R Diagram, we instantly felt quite overwhelmed trying to figure out what entities we might want to include - there was a lot of debate over how relevant different fields might be to our project and we were getting nowhere. So instead, we decided to step back. 

We began again by imagining what our application would actually look like on the frontend, comparing it to other slightly similar sites like Goldbelly or DoorDash. From here, we were able to determine key goals and characteristics for our project, therefore getting on the same page to continue forward. Our project would thus consist of connecting restaurants (and discounted  events that they are hosting) with customers (who can either already be a part of a group or join a new one) to experience the unique variety of Boston cooking.

This supported an ease in our E-R analysis first on a chalkboard, and then after moving around attributes, entities, and associated relationships, we formatted this into a clear E-R diagram using app.diagrams.net where we could share the diagram between us and collaborate. 

Next, we worked on formalizing this diagram into a schema - and therefore normalizing.

Normalization - Restaurants and Neighborhoods attribute for restaurant 
Is there any normalization we need to do for the menu items table?
