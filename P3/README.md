## A brief overview of our project â€” its purpose and its target audience:

Our project aims to address the problem of a lack of Boston area activity groups surrounding food! There is such a plethora of unique, spectacular small restaurants local to Boston that struggle to advertise to the general public and compete against the large, trendy brands. At the same time, with four out of the five of our group members being seniors, we worry about how we will make new friends after graduation. With this project, we look to solve both of these problems for like-minded individuals who love food! As such, our project will provide a platform for users to meet other Boston Foodies and make new friends in the area to explore restaurants with, tracking their favorite menu items. At the same time, local restaurants can host exclusive events to users with special discounts advertised through our site to gain exposure and a new fanbase.

## A description of any features we wish to draw the reader's attention to:
Our users have access to a large database of Boston restaurants, allowing them to uncover new places that meet their needs. Our home page provides access to a search filter for users to find restaurants by name, neighborhood, and cuisine type. Upon creating an account, users are invited to enter as either restaurant owners or customers.

Our events page allows users access to a list of events occurring at Boston restaurants. Customers are also allowed to leave reviews on the restaurants, which other users and owners can see. When logged in as a restaurant owner, users are able to create new events with set capacities. This allows owners to view their events, reviews, and  reach their targeted audience.
