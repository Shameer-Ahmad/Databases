A brief overview of our project â€” its purpose and its target audience:

Our project aims to address the problem of a lack of Boston area activity groups surrounding food! There is such a plethora of unique, spectacular small restaurants local to Boston that struggle to advertise to the general public and compete against the large, trendy brands. At the same time, with four out of the five of our group members being seniors, we worry about how we will make new friends after graduation. With this project, we look to solve both of these problems for like-minded individuals who love food! As such, our project will provide a platform for users to meet other Boston Foodies and make new friends in the area to explore restaurants with, tracking their favorite menu items. At the same time, local restaurants can host exclusive events to users with special discounts advertised through our site to gain exposure and a new fanbase.
